Abstract  â€”   Language models, similar to machine learning models, can display discriminatory behaviors due to statistical bias. This
bias can arise from the models being trained on data that reflects real-world asymmetries and biases, causing the models to
oversimplify complex relationships between variables to optimize accuracy. This leads to potential unfair treatment of individuals solely
based on shared characteristics with others in real-world situations with situational asymmetrical population distributions. The paper
focuses on the impact of statistical bias in a BERT model adapted for toxic language classification and proposes a debiasing technique
using counterfactual data augmentation to demonstrate its effectiveness. The related work section highlights the efforts made to enable
this type of research as well as other debiasing methods that have been used in similar tasks to debias language models. The study
finds that the proposed methods can reduce bias in toxic language systems, but there is still room for improvement. Ultimately, the
paper emphasizes the need for continued research and development in this area to ensure ethical and effective deployment of toxic
language systems.
